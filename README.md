 - TS2-1

Untouchable like
A distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out
And I just
Can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
And when you're close
I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven
It's half full
And I won't wait here
All day
I know you're saying
That you'd be here
Anyway
But you're
Untouchable burning
Brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like
A million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come onâ€¦
